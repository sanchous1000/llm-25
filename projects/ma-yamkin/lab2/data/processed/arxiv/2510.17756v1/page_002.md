driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained
with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves
SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving
ice regions.

1. Introduction
Dramatic declines in the Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice thickness
(SIT) have been observed for the last few decades along with a warming
climate resulting from the anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Notz and Stroeve,
2016). Arctic SIE has been reduced by more than 50,000 km2/year, and at
the same time, Arctic SIT has decreased by more than 2 m in average, with
more than a 50 % SIT reduction in thick multi-year ice (Kwok, 2018). With
such dramatic changes in SIE and SIT, the thermodynamic and dynamic
conditions of Arctic sea ice have entered a new phase (Wang et al., 2022;
Stroeve and Notz, 2018).
## Given that sea ice plays a critical role in the
physical conditions of the atmosphere and ocean (e.g., heat exchange, salinity,
etc.) (Haumann et al., 2016; Hirst, 1999; McPhee, 1992; Budikova, 2009),
understanding sea ice dynamics is essential for understanding the future of
the Arctic Ocean and global climate.
A traditional way to predict the sea ice dynamics in the Arctic Ocean is
using numerical models based on physics laws and equations that describe
sea ice in terms of mass and momentum balances, as well as its interaction
