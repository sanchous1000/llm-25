## Appendix A. Arctic SIC and SIV conditions from 2016 to 2022
Figures A.7a and b show the average SIV and SIC, respectively, over
the Arctic Ocean in 2022. The Fram Strait in eastern Greenland shows the
fastest ice movement. Figures A.7c and d show the monthly mean SIV and
SIC, respectively, in 2022. SIV decreased from January to June and increased
again thereafter. SIC was consistent to 90 % from January to May, decreased
to ∼70 % until September, and increased again from October.
