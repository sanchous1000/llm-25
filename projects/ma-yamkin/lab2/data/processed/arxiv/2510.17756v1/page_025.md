## Figure 2: (a) The reduction of SIV RMSE by PINNs with different training sample sizes
(20, 50, and 100 %) and combinations of λsat and λtherm (0, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0), relative
to the SIV RMSE of the No-Phy model. (b) The reduction of SIC RMSE by PINNs with
different training sample sizes and combinations of λsat and λtherm, relative to the SIC
RMSE of the No-Phy model. Cross markers indicate statistically significant reduction.
