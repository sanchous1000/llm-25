with the atmosphere and ocean (Stark et al., 2008; Fritzner et al., 2019;
Hibler, 1979; Parkinson and Washington, 1979). Although physics models
have successfully explained general sea ice behaviors by assuming sea ice as
viscous-plastic or elastic-viscous-plastic material (Hunke and Dukowicz, 1997;
Hibler, 1979), several challenges make it difficult to improve their fidelity
and efficiency. First, since countless atmospheric, oceanic, and even biologi-
cal variables are involved in sea ice dynamics, established physics equations
have limitations in explaining every detailed mechanism of sea ice dynamics.
## If the sea ice dynamics are partially governed by any unknown mechanisms,
physics models may not agree perfectly with the real observations. Second,
uncertainties in the complicated parameterization of sea ice physical condi-
tions, including initial and boundary conditions, can propagate through the
model predictions (Blockley et al., 2020; Hunke et al., 2010). Since real obser-
vations are not always available, physics models are often based on physical
assumptions. Considering that numerical models are sensitive to initial con-
ditions and physical assumptions, they can result in significant uncertainties
and discrepancies with real observations (Blanchard-Wrigglesworth et al.,
2015). Third, solving coupled and non-linear partial differential equations
(PDEs) is computationally intensive and expensive. Although adding more
complexity to a model or increasing model resolution can enhance the model’s
accuracy, it exponentially increases computational costs (Hunke et al., 2010;
Li et al., 2023). Hence, this computational demand inhibits improving the
model performance for higher spatial and temporal resolutions.
## Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged to predict sea
ice behaviors with fewer complexities and a lower computational cost than
