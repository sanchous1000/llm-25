with 20 % of training samples (Fig. 5h). When 20 % of training samples
are used, the SIV RMSE improvement by PINN reaches up to 10 % near
the central Arctic and northern Canadian Archipelago (Fig. 5g). When 50
% of training samples are used, RMSE reductions are observed across the
central Arctic, but it is not statistically significant, with less than 5 % SIV
improvement in most regions (Fig. 5h). Similarly, when 100 % samples are
used to train the model, <5 % of SIV RMSE reduction is observed across
the Arctic Ocean except central Arctic (Fig. 5i).
## The spatial distribution of SIC RMSE improvement (Fig. 6) exhibits a
different pattern from SIV. Above all, SIC RMSE improvement is observed
across the Arctic Ocean. The PINN approach plays a particularly important
role in improving SIC RMSE when only 20 % of training samples are used.
## When only 20 % of training samples are used to train the model, the baseline
SIC RMSE of the No-Phy model exceeds 4 % across the Arctic Ocean (Fig.
6a). However, by adopting PINN, SIC RMSE decreases significantly by up
to 50 % in the central Arctic (Fig. 6g). The improvement of SIC RMSE
by PINN is attenuated when more training samples are used. Although SIC
RMSE improvement is not significant with 50 % and 100 % sample exper-
iments, the effectiveness of PINN still appears widespread over the central
Arctic with up to ∼20 % (Fig. 6h and i).
5.4. Implications to future Arctic sea ice prediction
Given that many studies have shown the Arctic sea ice entered a new
state in the 2010s with a dramatic loss of sea ice cover (Stroeve and Notz,
2018; Meier et al., 2014; Guemas et al., 2016; Döscher et al., 2014), historical
satellite-based sea ice observations spanning over more than 40 years since
