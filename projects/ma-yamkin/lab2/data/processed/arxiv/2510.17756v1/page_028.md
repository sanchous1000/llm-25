## Figure 4: Monthly SIC RMSE of No-Phy model and PINN (λsat = 0.2 and λtherm = 0.2)
for seven test years (2016-2022). On the top panel, the solid lines indicate monthly SIC
RMSEs of PINN models, and the dashed lines indicate No-Phy models. The bottom panel
shows the differences between each PINN model and the No-Phy model.
## Statistically
significant decreases in RMSE by PINN are highlighted as circles in the bottom panel.
## Statistical significance of each month is determined by conducting a t-test on all daily
RMSE results from PINN and No-Phy. The shaded areas in the bottom panels show the
25-75 % quantile of RMSE difference.
0.5 % in all months, and such RMSE reduction is more significant in winter
months from January to March.
5.3. Spatial characteristics of model performance
In this section, we examine where the PINN approach is more or less
effective and discuss the implications of such spatial patterns. Herein, we
discuss only the PINN with λsat = 0.2 and λtherm = 0.2 configuration because
(1) this PINN setting shows overall best RMSE in all sampling sizes and (2)
the spatial patterns of PINN improvement appear similar for all different λsat
and λtherm values. The spatial distributions of SIV RMSE for PINN and No-
Phy models with different sample sizes are shown in Figure 5. As previously
discussed in Figures 2 and 3, the most substantial RMSE improvement occurs
