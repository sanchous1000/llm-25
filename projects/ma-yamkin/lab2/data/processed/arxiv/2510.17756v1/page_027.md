## Figure 3: Monthly SIV RMSE of No-Phy model and PINN (λsat = 0.2 and λtherm = 0.2)
for seven test years (2016-2022). On the top panel, the solid lines indicate monthly SIV
RMSEs of PINN models, and the dashed lines indicate No-Phy models. The bottom panel
shows the differences between each PINN model and the No-Phy model.
## Statistically
significant decreases in RMSE by PINN are highlighted as circles in the bottom panel.
## Statistical significance of each month is determined by conducting a t-test on all daily
RMSE results from PINN and No-Phy. The shaded areas in the bottom panels show the
25-75 % quantile of RMSE difference.
%, and the RMSE reduction is relatively greater during the winter months
(January to April) (Fig.
3).
## For the 50 % and 100 % sample sizes, no
significant temporal trend in the SIV performance improvement is found.
## Monthly RMSEs of SIC for test years are depicted in Figure 4. In contrast
to the SIV results, SIC exhibits relatively higher errors during the summer
months from June to July. While SIC remains consistently high from January
to May, it decreases rapidly in these months (Fig. A.7d); the model could
have difficulty capturing this trend. The most interesting finding is that SIC
RMSE is highly dependent on training sample size: SIC RMSE decreases with
a greater sample size. As a result, a more remarkable improvement in model
accuracy by PINN is observed with fewer sample sizes. When the models are
trained with 20 % of training samples, PINN reduces the SIC RMSE by >
