## Figure 5: The SIV RMSE map of the No-Phy model for (a) 20 % training samples, (b) 50
% training samples, and (c) 100 % training samples. The SIV RMSE map of the PINN
model (λsat = 0.2 and λtherm = 0.2) for (d) 20 % training samples, (e) 50 % training
samples, and (f) 100 % training samples. The relative SIV RMSE difference map between
PINN and No-Phy model for (g) 20 % training samples, (h) 50 % training samples, and (i)
100 % training samples. On the bottom panels of the RMSE differences, the reddish color
indicates the improvement in SIV RMSE by PINN over the No-Phy model (i.e., reduction
in RMSE).
