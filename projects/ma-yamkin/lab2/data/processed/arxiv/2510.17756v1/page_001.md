Abstract
As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becom-
ing widely used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration
(SIC). However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generaliz-
ability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quan-
tity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a
new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility
that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent
the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future.
## In this study,
we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate
physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchi-
cal Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the
physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plau-
sible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-
